        He was a Stoic philosopher and believed in living a virtuous life,
        maintaining self-control and accepting the things that he could not
        change. He is considered one of the Five Good Emperors of Rome, and his
        rule was marked by relative peace and prosperity.
      </p>

        Marcus Aurelius was a strong believer in the concept of &quot;stoic
        joy&quot; which is the ability to find joy in life regardless of the
        external circumstances. He died in 180 AD, after a long illness.
