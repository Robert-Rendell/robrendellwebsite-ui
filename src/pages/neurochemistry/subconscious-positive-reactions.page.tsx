        I have experienced both, in life, and I believe it is a result of your <u>current state of mind</u>, your <u>interpretation of reality</u> and your <u>reaction</u> to events.

        What does &apos;State of Mind&apos; actually mean?

      <p>
        State of mind, in my opinion, is the current (metaphorical) shape of your unconscious mind (subconscious).
      </p>
      <p>
        Our brains are programs that are constantly being reworked by experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inputs arrive from the outside and the current state of the program (your mind) determines the output.
      </p>
      <p>
        The outputs, of your mind, are reactions to situations and events.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Crucially, I believe when the world feels upside down, it is a direct result of your mind being conditioned
        with a negative outlook. I call this <u>&apos;Subconscious Negative Reactions&apos;</u>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        So now you know the basics, let us go through a few strategies for a more optimistic outlook:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Take control of your reactions;</li>
        <li>Actively and deliberately react positively to events, even if it is very difficult.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Practical routes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&apos;Have a good day!&apos; - When you are finished in a dialog with another person, say &apos;Have a good day!&apos;;</li>
        <li>Remember to smile!;</li>
        <li>Write down anything that made you happy today (eg. my lunch was tasty, I enjoyed my tea, getting outside was nice);</li>
        <li>Spend 5 mins with your eyes closed in a quiet space just imagining the sun on your face on a hot sunny holiday in Spain;</li>
        <li>Be grateful for: running clean water, shelter, for food, for your hands, for your legs;</li>
        <li>Think about your favourite things;</li>
        <li>Imagine cuddling dogs or cats.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>Most importantly, you need to do these things regularly to build habits to train your subconscious.</p>
      <p>Human memory is shit, that is one reason why we need computers. Do not rely on your memory.</p>
      <p>Write notes for yourself, so you are reminded.</p>
