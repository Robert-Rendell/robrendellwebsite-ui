        I have experienced both, in life, and I believe it is a result of your{" "}
        <u>current state of mind</u>, your <u>interpretation of reality</u> and
        your <u>reaction to events</u>.

      <p>
        State of mind, in my opinion, is the current (metaphorical) shape of
        your unconscious mind (subconscious).
      </p>
      <p>
        Our brains are programs that are constantly being reworked by
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inputs arrive from the outside and the current state of the program
        (your mind) determines the output.
      </p>
      <p>The outputs, of your mind, are reactions to situations and events.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Crucially, I believe when the world feels upside down, it is a direct
        result of your mind being conditioned with a negative outlook. I call
        this <u>&apos;Subconscious Negative Reactions&apos;</u>.

        So now you know the basics, let us go through a few strategies for a
        more optimistic / positive outlook:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Take control of your reactions;</li>
        <li>
          Actively and deliberately react positively to events, even if it is
          very difficult;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            Repeat your behaviour so your subconscious learns them; meaning you
            can be positive even when tired.
          </b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Practical routes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &apos;Have a good day!&apos; - When you are finished in a dialog with
          another person, say &apos;Have a good day!&apos;;
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember to smile (your body&apos;s happy chemicals are connected to
          the muscles in your face);
        </li>
        <li>
          Write down anything that made you happy today (eg. my lunch was tasty,
          I enjoyed my tea, getting outside was nice);
        </li>
        <li>

          If there are lots of negative things going on in your life, approach
