        One of the hardest mental blockers to remove is attachment.
      </p>
      <p>

        I do, however, believe that you can get close by doing something we are all familiar with: <u>sharing</u>!
      </p>
      <p>
        Share this project with your family and those who you think would benefit from this knowledge!
