        In the 1930s, it was found that haemoglobin has magnetic properties that
        are different depending on whether it is carrying oxygen or not. When
        the haemoglobin is not carrying oxygen it is more sensitive or
        paramagnetic than oxygenated blood. The earth also has a magnetic field,
        which is caused by electrical currents within the earth. The strength of
        a magnetic field is measured in teslas (T). The Earth&apos;s magnetic
        field is about 50ÂµT in New Zealand. Find out more about this in our
        article, fossil compass. Much higher magnetic fields are used in other
        magnets.
