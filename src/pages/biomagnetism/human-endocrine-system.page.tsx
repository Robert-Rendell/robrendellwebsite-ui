          Humans have evolved to recognise patterns because it is vital for our
          survival to adapt to changing environments.

          I see a pattern that has emerged from thousands of years of religion
          and ancient egyptian hieroglyphs.

          When does the pattern first emerge?

          When you imagine things in your mind, you are using your
          &quot;mind&apos;s eye&quot; to picture the subject internally.

        <p>
          Your &quot;mind&apos;s eye&quot; is also known as the &apos;third
          eye&apos;, which is referred to by many religions and cultures over
          millennia.

          I imagine at this point you have no idea where I am going with this
          topic. It&apos;s important to view all these connections (no matter
          how bizarre) to get an idea of how different cultures through the ages
          have conveyed their insight on human introspection.

        <QuestionComponent>What is the pineal gland?</QuestionComponent>
        <p>
          The pineal gland, conarium, or epiphysis cerebri, is a small endocrine
          gland in the brain of most vertebrates. The pineal gland produces
          melatonin, a serotonin-derived hormone which modulates sleep patterns
          in both circadian and seasonal cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pineal gland is located in the epithalamus, near the center of the
          brain, between the two hemispheres, tucked in a groove where the two
          halves of the thalamus join.

          In the 1930s, it was found that haemoglobin has magnetic properties
          that are different depending on whether it is carrying oxygen or not.
          When the haemoglobin is not carrying oxygen it is more sensitive or
          paramagnetic than oxygenated blood. The earth also has a magnetic
          field, which is caused by electrical currents within the earth. The
          strength of a magnetic field is measured in teslas (T). The Earth’s
          magnetic field is about 50µT in New Zealand. Find out more about this
          in our article, fossil compass. Much higher magnetic fields are used
          in other magnets.
