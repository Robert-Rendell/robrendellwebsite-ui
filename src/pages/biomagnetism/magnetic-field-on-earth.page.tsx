      <p>
        The flow of liquid iron at the center of the Earth generates an electric
        current that produces magnetic fields. Earth&apos;s magnetic field is
        produced very deep down in the core of the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cycle continues because the charged metals passing through these
        fields produce their electric currents. This type of self-sustaining
        loop is called the{" "}

          geodynamo
        </NewTabLink>
        . The collective effect of magnetic fields produces a single vast
        magnetic field going to the planet. This is the reason behind the
        magnetic fields on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength of a magnetic field is measured in teslas (T). The
        Earth&apos;s magnetic field is about 50ÂµT in New Zealand.
